        <h4 class="article-title">How COVID-19 Spreads</h4>
            <p>COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person: talks, sings, shouts, coughs, sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands. You can transmit COVID-19 before you start showing symptoms or without ever developing symptoms.</p>  
        <h4 class="article-title">Quarantine and Isolation</h4>
            <p>When indicated, people should quarantine or isolate to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others. If you've travelled outside of Canada recently, advice for your mandatory quarantine or isolation period may be different.</p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Prevention for Individuals</h4>
            <p>As efforts continue across Canada to increase overall vaccine coverage, public health measures remain the foundation of the pandemic response. Community transmission of COVID-19 continues in many areas across Canada, and new variants of concern have been identified and are circulating. This is why it's even more important to strictly use multiple personal preventive practices at once, regardless of your vaccination status. This is called a layered approach and it helps protect yourself and others. Think ahead about the actions you can take to: stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19</p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Prevention for Communities</h4>
            <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues in Canada, governments and public health authorities will continue to: make public health decisions, adjust restrictions depending on COVID-19 activity in their area. To prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19, governments will continue to apply public health measures in communities and settings where people gather. Canada is also supporting Indigenous communities in preparing for, monitoring and responding to COVID-19. Planners, administrators and employers must work together to protect: customers, employees, the general public, remote and isolated communities, people at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19.</p>
        <h4 class="article-title">Risks of Getting COVID-19</h4>
            <p>The risk of getting COVID-19 is evolving daily and varies between and within communities. Overall, the risk to most people in Canada remains high. This doesn't mean that everyone will get COVID-19. However, it means that there's already a significant impact on our health care system and transmission is occurring in many communities. To protect yourself and others: be mindful of the risk of exposure to the virus and consistently follow personal preventive practices and public health advice where you live</p>
